## List of projects

### 1. [Zelda Style Game:](https://github.com/SirChecho/small_projects/tree/master/games/zelda)
- I started re-creating a zelda-type videogame using pygame lybrary, where i had to use classes, functions and multiple python scripts, this is my first python project using git for version control and remote repositories

### 2. [Doom Style Game:](https://github.com/SirChecho/small_projects/tree/master/games/doom)
- After a lot of time (6 months at least) i finished the main body of zelda and wanted to move on, so i started a doom style game that requires more complex functions and the use of trigonometry and math because it use a ray casting algorithm, this is constructed in a two dimensional plane but creates the illusion of a three dimensional space
